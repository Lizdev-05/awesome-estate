# Awesome Estate
The Awesome estate web application displays a list of apartments that were provided by a local data. The users can check out the featured and recebt apartment. Also, the user can click the house to get the details of the selected house.

 The application consist of six pages, all of which are functioning.

This is a personal project I built to practise my knowledge of React js. The objective was to mimic the appearance of a dynamic web application, in a similar way a web developer would receive the requirements as if it were in a job.
